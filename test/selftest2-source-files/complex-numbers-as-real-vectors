"Complex numbers as real vectors"
clear
--Can complex number multiplication be simulated using real vectors?
--Yes, if a rank-3 tensor is used to do the multiply.
A = (AX, AY)
B = (BX, BY)
P = (AX BX - AY BY, AX BY + AY BX) --Complex number product in vector form
T11 = (1, 0)
T12 = (0, 1)
T21 = (0, -1)
T22 = (1, 0)
T = ((T11, T12), (T21, T22))
check(dot(A,T,B) - P = 0)
