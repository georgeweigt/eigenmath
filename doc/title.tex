Multiple commands can be put together in a script.
Scripts are run by clicking the Run button.
After a script runs, all of the results are available in command mode.
To export a result, click on the result text.
The result can now be printed or copied to the pasteboard.
(Note that it is necessary to click on the result text
instead of somewhere else in the result window.)
