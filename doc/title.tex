Multiple commands can be put together in a script.
Scripts are run by clicking the Run button.
After a script runs, all of the results are available in command mode.
To export a result, click on the result text.
The result can now be printed with \cmd$\,$P or copied to the pasteboard with \cmd$\,$C.
(Note that it is necessary to click on the result text
instead of somewhere else in the result window.)

Note: The fonts Times New Roman and Times New Roman Italic need
to be the standard macOS fonts that include special symbols and Greek letters.
See the following link for correcting font problems.
