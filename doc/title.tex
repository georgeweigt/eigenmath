Multiple commands can be put together in a script.
Scripts are run by clicking the Run button.
After a script runs, all of the results are available in command mode.
To export a result, click on the result text.
The result can now be printed with \cmd$\,$P or copied to the pasteboard with \cmd$\,$C.
(Note that it is necessary to click on the result text
instead of somewhere else in the result window.)

Note: The fonts Times New Roman and Times New Roman Italic need
to be the standard macOS fonts that include special symbols and Greek letters.
