\section*{Introduction}

From Vladimir Nabokov's autobiography ``Speak, Memory.''
\begin{quote}
A foolish tutor had explained logarithms to me much too early, and I had
read (in a British publication, the {\it Boy's Own Paper}, I believe)
about a certain Hindu calculator who in exactly two seconds could find the
seventeenth root of, say,
3529471145760275132301897342055866171392
(I am not sure I have got this right; anyway the root was 212).
\end{quote}

Example 1. Compute $212^{17}$.
(User input is shown in blue, results are shown in black.)

{\color{blue}
\begin{verbatim}
212^17
\end{verbatim}}

$3529471145760275132301897342055866171392$

\bigskip
Example 2. Compute $212^{17}$ and save as $N$,
then show the value of $N$.

{\color{blue}
\begin{verbatim}
N = 212^17
N
\end{verbatim}}

$N=3529471145760275132301897342055866171392$

\bigskip
Example 3. Compute the 17th root of $N$.

{\color{blue}
\begin{verbatim}
N^(1/17)
\end{verbatim}}

$212$

\bigskip
Example 4. How many 32-bit words does the value of $N$ require?
\begin{equation*}
2^{32n}=212^{17}
\end{equation*}

Hence
\begin{equation*}
n=\frac{17 \log212}{32\log2}
\end{equation*}

{\color{blue}
\begin{verbatim}
17 log(212.0) / (32 log(2.0))
\end{verbatim}}

$4.10546$
